### The project is structured into two main components

## The fetching component => fetching_deribit_data which is responsible for getting

    ## real time crypto currency prices and sending them to a rabbitmq queue.

## The persistence component => responsible for getting the data in the rabbitmq queue and inserting it to the db.

### To run the project you must have rabbitmq and postgres processes running on your local env

For that you can use the pre-configured docker compose file which will bootstrap a postgres, rabbitmq instances + it will bootsrap two python
processes which are responsible for fetching the data and inserting it into the db. 

To view the logs of the python process simply run this command `docker logs -f [container-id]`
